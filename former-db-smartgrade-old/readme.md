this smartgrade database is need to be converted in supabase setup
-it needs a storage for certificate
-the certificate that will be generated should be able to dynamically produce for each student just like the sample in smartgrade-vue/certificate-ampayon-high-school index.html file
-generate a qr code to access the certificate and can be accessed by all user just by scanning
-the database should also be refactor as it need the original SF9 and SF10 goals
